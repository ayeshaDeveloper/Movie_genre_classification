# Movie_Genre_classification
Multilabel_classification (prediction of movie genre from its poster)

# Overview
The "Movie Genre Classification" project is an advanced machine learning project aimed at classifying movies into multiple genres based on their descriptions. This project uses a dataset referred to as "Multilabel Dataset", which comprises movie descriptions tagged with up to 25 different genre labels. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the genre(s) of a movie given its description.

# Features
Multilabel Classification: Classify each movie into one or more of 25 possible genres.
Data Preprocessing: Includes techniques for text normalization and vectorization.
Model Training and Evaluation: Details on the models used, their performance metrics, and evaluation results.

# Dataset
The "Multilabel Dataset" used in this project contains movie descriptions with associated genre labels. Each movie can have multiple labels, making this a multilabel classification problem. The dataset is not included in this repository due to size and privacy considerations but can be obtained from kaggle.

# Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following software/tools installed:

Python 3.8 or above
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
